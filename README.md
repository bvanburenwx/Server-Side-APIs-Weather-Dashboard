# Server-Side-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

## Description:

This application will get the local weather for a city that is chosen by the user. Once the user types in a city and presses the search button, the current weather will show, as well as, the 5 day forecast for that area. This search will also be added to local storage and if the user comes back to this site they will have a new button conveniently added so they do not have to retype the same city.
